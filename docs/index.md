## Introduction

Windows Command shell program that is a wrapper for ADDS toolset:
	- `DSQUERY`
	- `DSGET`
	- `DSADD`
	- `DSMOD`
	- `DSMOVE`
	
The advantage of using ADDS Tool over something like [Active Directory Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer):
 - Command shell is faster.
 - Navigating shell menu is quicker.
 - Every search is saved to log file; text files are easy to extract information from, and stores a historical search record.
 - ADDS Tool allows setting parameters, most important is the `-limit` parameter, which by default is set to `-limit 0`.

*Why not PowerShell?*
I like the windows command shell. It does most of what's needed. When the shell is lacking, PowerShell can be leveraged, which the program does.


## Dependencies

ADDS_Tool requires (RSAT) [Remote Server Administrative Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/remote-server-administration-tools). 
The program will ask to install if not detected, using [DISM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/what-is-dism). 
Must be runnig with administartive privilege in order to install RSAT. 

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview): Leveraged for some functions.
